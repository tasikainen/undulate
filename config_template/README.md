# config_template
This folder contains templates of configuration files. Please modify the template with data specific to your environment, and copy and rename the folder one level up: the folder should be located on the same level as the **nivel2** and/or **undulate** folders.

The `k8s-cc5-default-conf` is best generated as instructed in the **cluster_control** component. The file included is included as a template for reference only, with relevant values modified or deprecated with .../xxx.
